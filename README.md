# GNU Utils.py
The implementation of some very known GNU utilities using Phyton. I decided to write this utilities while learnig the Phython language syntax and to get something fun to do, instead of some of those annoying Hello World programs.

## cat
Phyton implementation for cat, an utility to concatenate files to standard output

## cut

Phyton implementation for cut, an utility to cut content from lines read from input file

https://github.com/aldebap/GnuUtils.py/tree/master/cut/src

## tr
Phyton implementation for tr, an utility to translate, squeeze, and/or delete characters from standard input

https://github.com/aldebap/GnuUtils.py/tree/master/tr/src

## wc
Phyton implementation for wc, an utility to count characters, words and lines from an input file

https://github.com/aldebap/GnuUtils.py/tree/master/wc/src

## grep

## sort

Phyton implementation for sort, an utility to sort lines from an input file. The following features were implemented:

-b, --ignore-leading-blanks *for the sake of sorting, ignore any blank character from the begining of a line*

-f, --ignore-case *for the sake of sorting, treat lower case as the same as upper case characters*

-w, --reverse *generate the output in descending order*
